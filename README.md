  recursive_worker_count 5

  def process(user_id)
    User.destroy(user_id)
  end
end

user_ids = User.where(is_old: true).ids
CleanUpOldUsers.run(user_ids)
```

#### before_all and after_all hooks
```ruby
class CleanUpOldUsers
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include Sidekiq::Recursive::Worker

  recursive_worker_count 5
  before_all :bar
  after_all :foo

  def bar
    # do something before starting all workers
  end

  def process(user_id)
    User.destroy(user_id)

  def foo
    # do something after all workers are finished
  end
end
```
